# Bunny, a Ruby RabbitMQ Client

Bunny is a synchronous RabbitMQ client that focuses on ease of use. With the next
0.9 release (currently in master), it is feature complete, supports all RabbitMQ 3.0
features and is free of many limitations of earlier versions.


## Supported Ruby Versions

Bunny 0.9 and more recent versions support Ruby 1.9.3, 1.9.2, JRuby 1.7, Rubinius 2.0 and 1.8.7.


## Supported RabbitMQ Versions

Bunny `0.8.x` and later versions only support RabbitMQ 2.x and 3.x.
Bunny `0.7.x` and earlier versions support RabbitMQ 1.x and 2.x.


## Changes in Bunny 0.9

Bunny is a very old library with **a lot** of missing functionality. It also implements an older version of the spec
and may or may not work with future RabbitMQ versions. As such, Bunny needed serious internal changes.
We (the maintainers) make our best to keep the new version as backwards compatible as possible but within reason.

See [this announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ruby-amqp/crNVGEuHm68) to learn more.


## Installation & Bundler Dependency

To install Bunny 0.9.x with RubyGems:

```
gem install bunny --pre
```

To use Bunny 0.9.x in a project managed with Bundler:

``` ruby
gem "bunny", ">= 0.9.0.pre7" # optionally: , :git => "git://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny.git", :branch => "master"
```


## Quick Start for Bunny 0.9.x

Below is a small snippet that demonstrates how to publish
and synchronously consume ("pull API") messages with Bunny 0.9.

For a 15 minute tutorial using more practical examples, see [Getting Started with RabbitMQ and Ruby using Bunny](http://rubybunny.info/articles/getting_started.html).

``` ruby
require "bunny"

# Start a communication session with RabbitMQ
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

# open a channel
ch = conn.create_channel

# declare a queue
q  = ch.queue("test1")

# declare default direct exchange which is bound to all queues
e  = ch.default_exchange

# publish a message to the exchange which then gets routed to the queue
e.publish("Hello, everybody!", :routing_key => 'test1')

# fetch a message from the queue
delivery_info, metadata, payload = q.pop

puts "This is the message: #{payload}"

# close the connection
conn.stop
```

When filing an issue, please specify which Bunny and RabbitMQ versions you are using, provide recent RabbitMQ log file contents if possible,
and try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus points for contributing failing test cases.


## Other Ruby RabbitMQ Clients

Other widely used Ruby RabbitMQ clients are [Hot Bunnies](http://github.com/ruby-amqp/hot_bunnies) (JRuby-only) and [amqp gem](http://rubyamqp.info).
Both are mature libraries and require RabbitMQ 2.x or 3.x.


## Contributing

First, clone the repository and run

    bundle install --binstubs

then set up RabbitMQ vhosts with

    ./bin/ci/before_build.sh

(if needed, set `RABBITMQCTL` env variable to point to `rabbitmqctl` you want to use)

and then run tests with

    ./bin/rspec -cfs spec

After that create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request
on GitHub.
