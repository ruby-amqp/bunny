    # The default exchange. Default exchange is a direct exchange that is predefined.
    # It cannot be removed. Every queue is bind to this (direct) exchange by default with
    # the following routing semantics: messages will be routed to the queue withe same
    # same name as message's routing key. In other words, if a message is published with
    # a routing key of "weather.usa.ca.sandiego" and there is a queue Q with this name,
    # that message will be routed to Q.
