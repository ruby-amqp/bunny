## Exchanges in AMQP 0.9.1 â€” Overview

### What are AMQP exchanges?

An *exchange* accepts messages from a producer application and routes
them to message queues. They can be thought of as the "mailboxes" of
the AMQP world. Unlike some other messaging middleware products and
protocols, in AMQP, messages are *not* published directly to queues.
Messages are published to exchanges that route them to queue(s) using
pre-arranged criteria called *bindings*.

There are multiple exchange types in the AMQP 0.9.1 specification,
each with its own routing semantics. Custom exchange types can be
created to deal with sophisticated routing scenarios (e.g. routing
based on geolocation data or edge cases) or just for convenience.

### Concept of Bindings

A *binding* is an association between a queue and an exchange. A queue
must be bound to at least one exchange in order to receive messages
from publishers. Learn more about bindings in the [Bindings
guide](/articles/bindings.html).

### Exchange attributes

Exchanges have several attributes associated with them:

 * Name
 * Type (direct, fanout, topic, headers or some custom type)
 * Durability
 * Whether the exchange is auto-deleted when no longer used
 * Other metadata (sometimes known as *X-arguments*)


## Exchange types

There are four built-in exchange types in AMQP v0.9.1:

 * Direct
 * Fanout
 * Topic
 * Headers

As stated previously, each exchange type has its own routing semantics
and new exchange types can be added by extending brokers with
plugins. Custom exchange types begin with "x-", much like custom HTTP
headers, e.g. [x-consistent-hash
exchange](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange)
or [x-random exchange](https://github.com/jbrisbin/random-exchange).

## Message attributes

Before we start looking at various exchange types and their routing
semantics, we need to introduce message attributes. Every AMQP message
has a number of *attributes*. Some attributes are important and used
very often, others are rarely used. AMQP message attributes are
metadata and are similar in purpose to HTTP request and response
headers.

Every AMQP 0.9.1 message has an attribute called *routing key*. The
routing key is an "address" that the exchange may use to decide how to
route the message. This is similar to, but more generic than, a URL in
HTTP. Most exchange types use the routing key to implement routing
logic, but some ignore it and use other criteria (e.g. message
content).


## Fanout exchanges

### How fanout exchanges route messages

A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound
to it and the routing key is ignored. If N queues are bound to a
fanout exchange, when a new message is published to that exchange a
*copy of the message* is delivered to all N queues. Fanout exchanges
are ideal for the [broadcast
routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28computing%29) of
messages.

Graphically this can be represented as:

![fanout exchange routing](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/004_fanout_exchange.png)

### Declaring a fanout exchange

There are two ways to declare a fanout exchange:

 * Using the `Bunny::Channel#fanout` method
 * Instantiate `Bunny::Exchange` directly

Here are two examples to demonstrate:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.fanout("activity.events")
```

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = Bunny::Exchange.new(ch, :fanout, "activity.events")
```

### Fanout routing example

To demonstrate fanout routing behavior we can declare ten server-named
exclusive queues, bind them all to one fanout exchange and then
publish a message to the exchange:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

puts "=> Fanout exchange routing"
puts

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.fanout("examples.pings")

10.times do |i|
  q = ch.queue("", :auto_delete => true).bind(x)
  q.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
    puts "[consumer] #{q.name} received a message: #{payload}"
  end
end

x.publish("Ping")

sleep 0.5
x.delete
puts "Disconnecting..."
conn.close
```

When run, this example produces the following output:

<pre>
=> Fanout exchange routing

[consumer] amq.gen-A8z-tj-n_0U39GdPGncV-A received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-jht-OtRwdD8LuHMxrA5SNQ received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-LQTh8IdojOCrvOnEuFog8w received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-PV-Dg8_gSvLO9eK6le6wwQ received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-ofAMc3FXRZIj3O55fXDSwA received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-TXJiZEjwZ0squ12_Z9mP0A received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-XQjh2xrC9khbMZMg_0Zzfw received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-XVSKsdWwhyxRiJn-jAFEGg received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-ZaY2pD_9NaOICxAMWPoIYw received a message: Ping
[consumer] amq.gen-oElfvP_crgASWkk6EhrJLA received a message: Ping
Disconnecting...
</pre>

Each of the queues bound to the exchange receives a *copy* of the
message.


### Fanout use cases

Because a fanout exchange delivers a copy of a message to every queue bound to it, its use cases are quite similar:

 * Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games can use it for leaderboard updates or other global events
 * Sport news sites can use fanout exchanges for distributing score updates to mobile clients in near real-time
 * Distributed systems can broadcast various state and configuration updates
 * Group chats can distribute messages between participants using a fanout exchange (although AMQP does not have a built-in concept of presence, so [XMPP](http://xmpp.org) may be a better choice)

### Pre-declared fanout exchanges

AMQP 0.9.1 brokers must implement a fanout exchange type and
pre-declare one instance with the name of `"amq.fanout"`.

Applications can rely on that exchange always being available to
them. Each vhost has a separate instance of that exchange, it is *not
shared across vhosts* for obvious reasons.

## Direct exchanges

### How direct exchanges route messages

A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on a *message
routing key*, an attribute that every AMQP v0.9.1 message contains.

Here is how it works:

 * A queue binds to the exchange with a routing key K
 * When a new message with routing key R arrives at the direct exchange, the exchange routes it to the queue if K = R

A direct exchange is ideal for the [unicast
routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast) of messages (although
they can be used for [multicast
routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast) as well).

Here is a graphical representation:

![direct exchange routing](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/005_direct_exchange.png)


### Declaring a direct exchange

 * Using the `Bunny::Channel#direct` method
 * Instantiate `Bunny::Exchange` directly

Here are two examples to demonstrate:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.direct("imaging")
```

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = Bunny::Exchange.new(ch, :direct, "imaging")
```


### Direct routing example

Since direct exchanges use the *message routing key* for routing,
message producers need to specify it:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

puts "=> Direct exchange routing"
puts

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.direct("examples.imaging")

q1 = ch.queue("", :auto_delete => true).bind(x, :routing_key => "resize")
q1.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "[consumer] #{q1.name} received a 'resize' message"
end
q2 = ch.queue("", :auto_delete => true).bind(x, :routing_key => "watermark")
q2.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "[consumer] #{q2.name} received a 'watermark' message"
end

# just an example
data = rand.to_s
x.publish(data, :routing_key => "resize")
x.publish(data, :routing_key => "watermark")

sleep 0.5
x.delete
q1.delete
q2.delete

puts "Disconnecting..."
conn.close
```

The routing key will then be compared for equality with routing keys
on bindings, and consumers that subscribed with the same routing key
each get a copy of the message.

Output for the example looks like this:

```
=> Direct exchange routing

[consumer] amq.gen-8XIeaBCmykwnJUtHVEkT5Q received a 'resize' message
[consumer] amq.gen-Zht5YW3_MhK-YBLZouxp5Q received a 'watermark' message
Disconnecting...
```


### Direct Exchanges and Load Balancing of Messages

Direct exchanges are often used to distribute tasks between multiple
workers (instances of the same application) in a round robin manner.
When doing so, it is important to understand that, in AMQP 0.9.1,
*messages are load balanced between consumers and not between queues*.

The [Queues and Consumers](/articles/queues.html) guide provides more
information on this subject.

### Pre-declared direct exchanges

AMQP 0.9.1 brokers must implement a direct exchange type and
pre-declare two instances:

 * `amq.direct`
 * *""* exchange known as *default exchange* (unnamed, referred to as an empty string by many clients including Bunny)

Applications can rely on those exchanges always being available to
them. Each vhost has separate instances of those exchanges, they are
*not shared across vhosts* for obvious reasons.


### Default exchange

The default exchange is a direct exchange with no name (Bunny refers
to it using an empty string) pre-declared by the broker. It has one
special property that makes it very useful for smaller applications,
namely that *every queue is automatically bound to it with a routing
key which is the same as the queue name*.

For example, when you declare a queue with the name of
"search.indexing.online", RabbitMQ will bind it to the default
exchange using "search.indexing.online" as the routing key. Therefore
a message published to the default exchange with routing key =
"search.indexing.online" will be routed to the queue
"search.indexing.online".  In other words, the default exchange makes
it *seem like it is possible to deliver messages directly to queues*,
even though that is not technically what is happening.

The default exchange is used by the "Hello, World" example:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch = conn.create_channel
q  = ch.queue("bunny.examples.hello_world", :auto_delete => true)

q.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "Received #{payload}"
end

q.publish("Hello!", :routing_key => q.name)

sleep 1.0
conn.close
```


### Direct Exchange Use Cases

Direct exchanges can be used in a wide variety of cases:

 * Direct (near real-time) messages to individual players in an MMO game
 * Delivering notifications to specific geographic locations (for example, points of sale)
 * Distributing tasks between multiple instances of the same application all having the same function, for example, image processors
 * Passing data between workflow steps, each having an identifier (also consider using headers exchange)
 * Delivering notifications to individual software services in the network

## Topic Exchanges

### How Topic Exchanges Route Messages

Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues based on matching
between a message routing key and the pattern that was used to bind a
queue to an exchange.  The topic exchange type is often used to
implement various [publish/subscribe
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe) variations.

Topic exchanges are commonly used for the [multicast
routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast) of messages.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Multicast.svg/500px-Multicast.svg.png)

Topic exchanges can be used for [broadcast
routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28computing%29),
but fanout exchanges are usually more efficient for this use case.

### Topic Exchange Routing Example

Two classic examples of topic-based routing are stock price updates
and location-specific data (for instance, weather
broadcasts). Consumers indicate which topics they are interested in
(think of it like subscribing to a feed for an individual tag of your
favourite blog as opposed to the full feed). The routing is enabled by
specifying a *routing pattern* to the `Bunny::Queue#bind` method, for
example:

``` ruby
x    = ch.topic("weather", :auto_delete => true)

q = ch.queue("americas.south", :auto_delete => true).bind(x, :routing_key => "americas.south.#")
q.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for South America: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
```

In the example above we bind a queue with the name of "americas.south" to the topic exchange declared earlier using the `Bunny::Queue#bind` method. This means that
only messages with a routing key matching "americas.south.#" will be routed to the "americas.south" queue.

A routing pattern consists of several words separated by dots, in a
similar way to URI path segments being joined by slash. A few of
examples:

 * asia.southeast.thailand.bangkok
 * sports.basketball
 * usa.nasdaq.aapl
 * tasks.search.indexing.accounts

The following routing keys match the "americas.south.#" pattern:

 * americas.south
 * americas.south.*brazil*
 * americas.south.*brazil.saopaulo*
 * americas.south.*chile.santiago*

In other words, the "#" part of the pattern matches 0 or more words.

For the pattern "americas.south.*", some matching routing keys are:

 * americas.south.*brazil*
 * americas.south.*chile*
 * americas.south.*peru*

but not

 * americas.south
 * americas.south.chile.santiago

As you can see, the "*" part of the pattern matches 1 word only.


Full example:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start

channel  = connection.create_channel
# topic exchange name can be any string
exchange = channel.topic("weather", :auto_delete => true)

# Subscribers.
channel.queue("americas.north").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "americas.north.#").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for North America: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
channel.queue("americas.south").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "americas.south.#").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for South America: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
channel.queue("us.california").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "americas.north.us.ca.*").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for US/California: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
channel.queue("us.tx.austin").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "#.tx.austin").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for Austin, TX: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
channel.queue("it.rome").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "europe.italy.rome").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for Rome, Italy: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end
channel.queue("asia.hk").bind(exchange, :routing_key => "asia.southeast.hk.#").subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "An update for Hong Kong: #{payload}, routing key is #{delivery_info.routing_key}"
end

exchange.publish("San Diego update", :routing_key => "americas.north.us.ca.sandiego").
  publish("Berkeley update",         :routing_key => "americas.north.us.ca.berkeley").
  publish("San Francisco update",    :routing_key => "americas.north.us.ca.sanfrancisco").
  publish("New York update",         :routing_key => "americas.north.us.ny.newyork").
  publish("SÃ£o Paulo update",        :routing_key => "americas.south.brazil.saopaulo").
  publish("Hong Kong update",        :routing_key => "asia.southeast.hk.hongkong").
  publish("Kyoto update",            :routing_key => "asia.southeast.japan.kyoto").
  publish("Shanghai update",         :routing_key => "asia.southeast.prc.shanghai").
  publish("Rome update",             :routing_key => "europe.italy.roma").
  publish("Paris update",            :routing_key => "europe.france.paris")

sleep 1.0

connection.close
```

### Topic Exchange Use Cases

Topic exchanges have a very broad set of use cases. Whenever a problem
involves multiple consumers/applications that selectively choose which
type of messages they want to receive, the use of topic exchanges
should be considered. To name a few examples:

 * Distributing data relevant to specific geographic location, for example, points of sale
 * Background task processing done by multiple workers, each capable of handling specific set of tasks
 * Stocks price updates (and updates on other kinds of financial data)
 * News updates that involve categorization or tagging (for example, only for a particular sport or team)
 * Orchestration of services of different kinds in the cloud
 * Distributed architecture/OS-specific software builds or packaging where each builder can handle only one architecture or OS


## Declaring/Instantiating Exchanges

With Bunny, exchanges can be declared in two ways: by instantiating
`Bunny::Exchange` or by using a number of convenience methods on
`Bunny::Channel`:

  * `Bunny::Channel#default_exchange`
  * `Bunny::Channel#direct`
  * `Bunny::Channel#topic`
  * `Bunny::Channel#fanout`
  * `Bunny::Channel#headers`

The previous sections on specific exchange types (direct, fanout,
headers, etc.) provide plenty of examples of how these methods can be
used.

## Checking if an Exchange Exists

Sometimes it's convenient to check if an exchange exists. To do so, at the protocol
level you use `exchange.declare` with `passive` sets to `true`. In response
RabbitMQ responds with a channel exception if the exchange does not exist.

Bunny provides a convenience method, `Bunny::Session#exchange_exists?`, to do this:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

conn.exchange_exists?("logs")
```


## Publishing messages

To publish a message to an exchange, use `Bunny::Exchange#publish`:

``` ruby
x.publish("some data")
```

The method accepts message body and a number of message and delivery metadata options. Routing key can be blank (`""`) but never `nil`.
The body needs to be a string. The message payload is completely opaque to the library and is not modified by Bunny or RabbitMQ in any way.

### Data serialization

You are encouraged to take care of data serialization before publishing (i.e. by using JSON, Thrift, Protocol Buffers or some other serialization library).
Note that because AMQP is a binary protocol, text formats like JSON largely lose their advantage of being easy to inspect as data travels across the network,
so if bandwidth efficiency is important, consider using [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) or [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/).

A few popular options for data serialization are:

 * JSON: [json gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) (part of standard Ruby library on Ruby 1.9) or [yajl-ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/yajl-ruby) (Ruby bindings to YAJL)
 * BSON: [bson gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bson) for JRuby (implemented as a Java extension) or [bson_ext](https://rubygems.org/bson_ext) for C-based Rubies
 * [Message Pack](http://msgpack.org) has Ruby bindings and provides a Java implementation for JRuby
 * XML: [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org) is a swiss army knife for XML processing with Ruby, built on top of libxml2
 * Protocol Buffers: [beefcake](https://github.com/bmizerany/beefcake)

### Message metadata

RabbitMQ messages have various metadata attributes that can be set
when a message is published. Some of the attributes are well-known and
mentioned in the AMQP 0.9.1 specification, others are specific to a
particular application. Well-known attributes are listed here as
options that `Bunny::Exchange#publish` takes:

 * `:persistent`
 * `:mandatory`
 * `:timestamp`
 * `:expiration`
 * `:type`
 * `:reply_to`
 * `:content_type`
 * `:content_encoding`
 * `:correlation_id`
 * `:priority`
 * `:message_id`
 * `:user_id`
 * `:app_id`

All other attributes can be added to a *headers table* (in Ruby, a
hash) that `Bunny::Exchange#publish` accepts as the `:headers` option.

An example:

``` ruby
# or Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) if using a monotonic clock is important
now = Time.now

x.publish("hello",
          :routing_key => queue_name,
          :app_id      => "bunny.example",
          :priority    => 8,
          :type        => "kinda.checkin",
          # headers table keys can be anything
          :headers     => {
            :coordinates => {
              :latitude  => 59.35,
              :longitude => 18.066667
            },
            :time         => now,
            :participants => 11,
            :venue        => "Stockholm",
            :true_field   => true,
            :false_field  => false,
            :nil_field    => nil,
            :ary_field    => ["one", 2.0, 3, [{"abc" => 123}]]
          },
          :timestamp      => now.to_i,
          :reply_to       => "a.sender",
          :correlation_id => "r-1",
          :message_id     => "m-1")
```

  <dd>Message expiration specification as a string</dd>

  <dt>:arguments</dt>
  <dd>A map of any additional attributes that the application needs. Nested hashes are supported. Keys must be strings.</dd>
</dl>

It is recommended that application authors use well-known message
attributes when applicable instead of relying on custom headers or
placing information in the message body.  For example, if your
application messages have priority, publishing timestamp, type and
content type, you should use the respective AMQP message attributes
instead of reinventing the wheel.


### Validated User ID

In some scenarios it is useful for consumers to be able to know the
identity of the user who published a message. RabbitMQ implements a
feature known as [validated User
ID](http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#validated-user-id).  If
this property is set by a publisher, its value must be the same as the
name of the user used to open the connection. If the user-id property
is not set, the publisher's identity is not validated and remains
private.


### Publishing Callbacks and Reliable Delivery in Distributed Environments

A commonly asked question about RabbitMQ clients is "how to execute a
piece of code after a message is received".

Message publishing with Bunny happens in several steps:

 * `Bunny::Exchange#publish` takes a payload and various metadata attributes
 * Resulting payload is staged for writing
 * On the next event loop tick, data is transferred to the OS kernel using one of the underlying NIO APIs
 * OS kernel buffers data before sending it
 * Network driver may also employ buffering

<div class="alert alert-error"> As you can see, "when data is sent" is
a complicated issue and while methods to flush buffers exist, flushing
buffers does not guarantee that the data was received by the broker
because it might have crashed while data was travelling down the wire.

The only way to reliably know whether data was received by the broker or a peer application is to use message acknowledgements. This is how TCP works and this
approach is proven to work at the enormous scale of the modern Internet. AMQP 0.9.1 fully embraces this fact and Bunny follows.
</div>

In cases when you cannot afford to lose a single message, AMQP 0.9.1
applications can use one (or a combination of) the following protocol
features:

 * Publisher confirms (a RabbitMQ-specific extension to AMQP 0.9.1)
 * Publishing messages as mandatory
 * Transactions (these introduce noticeable overhead and have a relatively narrow set of use cases)

A more detailed overview of the pros and cons of each option can be
found in a [blog post that introduces Publisher Confirms
extension](http://bit.ly/rabbitmq-publisher-confirms) by the RabbitMQ
team. The next sections of this guide will describe how the features
above can be used with Bunny.


### Publishing messages as mandatory

When publishing messages, it is possible to use the `:mandatory`
option to publish a message as "mandatory". When a mandatory message
cannot be *routed* to any queue (for example, there are no bindings or
none of the bindings match), the message is returned to the producer.

The following code example demonstrates a message that is published as
mandatory but cannot be routed (no bindings) and thus is returned back
to the producer:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

### Returned messages

When a message is returned, the application that produced it can
handle that message in different ways:

 * Store it for later redelivery in a persistent store
 * Publish it to a different destination
 * Log the event and discard the message

Returned messages contain information about the exchange they were
published to. Bunny associates returned message callbacks with
consumers. To handle returned messages, use
`Bunny::Exchange#on_return`:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

puts "=> Publishing messages as mandatory"
puts

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.default_exchange

x.on_return do |return_info, properties, content|
  puts "Got a returned message: #{content}"
end

q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
q.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, content|
  puts "Consumed a message: #{content}"
end

x.publish("This will NOT be returned", :mandatory => true, :routing_key => q.name)
x.publish("This will be returned", :mandatory => true, :routing_key => "akjhdfkjsh#{rand}")

sleep 0.5
puts "Disconnecting..."
conn.close
```

A returned message handler has access to AMQP method (`basic.return`)
information, message metadata and payload (as a byte array).  The
metadata and message body are returned without modifications so that
the application can store the message for later redelivery.


### Publishing Persistent Messages

Messages potentially spend some time in the queues to which they were
routed before they are consumed. During this period of time, the
broker may crash or experience a restart.  To survive it, messages
must be persisted to disk. This has a negative effect on performance,
especially with network attached storage like NAS devices and Amazon
EBS.  AMQP 0.9.1 lets applications trade off performance for
durability, or vice versa, on a message-by-message basis.

To publish a persistent message, use the `:persistent` option that
`Bunny::Exchange#publish` accepts:

``` ruby
x.publish(data, :persistent => true)
```

**Note** that in order to survive a broker crash, the messages MUST be persistent and the queue that they were routed to MUST be durable.

[Durability and Message Persistence](/articles/durability.html) provides more information on the subject.

### Message Priority

Starting with RabbitMQ 3.5, queues can be [instructed to support
message priorities](https://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html).

To specify a priority on a message, pass the `:priority` key to
`Bunny::Exchange#publish`. Note that priority queues have certain
[limitations listed in the RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html).


### Publishing In Multi-threaded Environments

<div class="alert alert-error">
When using Bunny in multi-threaded
environments, the rule of thumb is: avoid sharing channels across
threads.
</div>

In other words, publishers in your application that publish from
separate threads should use their own channels. The same is a good
idea for consumers.


## Headers exchanges

Now that message attributes and publishing have been introduced, it is
time to take a look at one more core exchange type in AMQP 0.9.1. It
is called the *headers exchange type* and is quite powerful.

### How headers exchanges route messages

#### An Example Problem Definition

The best way to explain headers-based routing is with an
example. Imagine a distributed [continuous
integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
system that distributes builds across multiple machines with different
hardware architectures (x86, IA-64, AMD64, ARM family and so on) and
operating systems.  It strives to provide a way for a community to
contribute machines to run tests on and a nice build matrix like [the
one WebKit uses](http://build.webkit.org/waterfall?category=core).
One key problem such systems face is build distribution. It would be
nice if a messaging broker could figure out which machine has which
OS, architecture or combination of the two and route build request
messages accordingly.

A headers exchange is designed to help in situations like this by
routing on multiple attributes that are more easily expressed as
message metadata attributes (headers) rather than a routing key
string.

#### Routing on Multiple Message Attributes

Headers exchanges route messages based on message header
matching. Headers exchanges ignore the routing key attribute. Instead,
the attributes used for routing are taken from the "headers"
attribute. When a queue is bound to a headers exchange, the
`:arguments` attribute is used to define matching rules:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("hosts.ip-172-37-11-56")
x = ch.headers("requests")

q.bind(x, :arguments => {"os" => "linux"})
```

When matching on one header, a message is considered matching if the
value of the header equals the value specified upon binding. An
example that demonstrates headers routing:

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "bunny"

puts "=> Headers exchange routing"
puts

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
x    = ch.headers("headers")

q1   = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true).bind(x, :arguments => {"os" => "linux", "cores" => 8, "x-match" => "all"})
q2   = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true).bind(x, :arguments => {"os" => "osx",   "cores" => 4, "x-match" => "any"})

q1.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, content|
  puts "#{q1.name} received #{content}"
end
q2.subscribe do |delivery_info, properties, content|
  puts "#{q2.name} received #{content}"
end

x.publish("8 cores/Linux", :headers => {"os" => "linux", "cores" => 8})
x.publish("8 cores/OS X",  :headers => {"os" => "osx",   "cores" => 8})
x.publish("4 cores/Linux", :headers => {"os" => "linux", "cores" => 4})

sleep 0.5
conn.close
```

When executed, it outputs

```
=> Headers exchange routing

amq.gen-xhIzykDAjfcC4orMsi0O6Q received 8 cores/Linux
amq.gen-6O1oKjVd8QbKr7zyy7ssbg received 8 cores/OS X
amq.gen-6O1oKjVd8QbKr7zyy7ssbg received 4 cores/Linux
```


#### Matching All vs Matching One

It is possible to bind a queue to a headers exchange using more than
one header for matching. In this case, the broker needs one more piece
of information from the application developer, namely, should it
consider messages with any of the headers matching, or all of them?
This is what the "x-match" binding argument is for.

When the `"x-match"` argument is set to `"any"`, just one matching
header value is sufficient. So in the example above, any message with
a "cores" header value equal to 8 will be considered matching.



### Declaring a Headers Exchange

There are two ways to declare a headers exchange, either instantiate
`Bunny::Exchange` directly:

``` ruby
x = Bunny::Exchange.new(ch, :headers, "matching")
```

Or use the `Bunny::Channel#headers` method:

``` ruby
x = ch.headers("matching")
```

### Headers Exchange Routing

When there is just one queue bound to a headers exchange, messages are
routed to it if any or all of the message headers match those
specified upon binding.  Whether it is "any header" or "all of them"
depends on the `"x-match"` header value. In the case of multiple
queues, a headers exchange will deliver a copy of a message to each
queue, just like direct exchanges do. Distribution rules between
consumers on a particular queue are the same as for a direct exchange.

### Headers Exchange Use Cases

Headers exchanges can be looked upon as "direct exchanges on steroids"
and because they route based on header values, they can be used as
direct exchanges where the routing key does not have to be a string;
it could be an integer or a hash (dictionary) for example.

Some specific use cases:

 * Transfer of work between stages in a multi-step workflow ([routing slip pattern](http://eaipatterns.com/RoutingTable.html))
 * Distributed build/continuous integration systems can distribute builds based on multiple parameters (OS, CPU architecture, availability of a particular package).


### Pre-declared Headers Exchanges

RabbitMQ implements a headers exchange type and pre-declares one
instance with the name of `"amq.match"`. RabbitMQ also pre-declares
one instance with the name of `"amq.headers"`. Applications can rely
on those exchanges always being available to them.  Each vhost has a
separate instance of those exchanges and they are *not shared across
vhosts* for obvious reasons.

## Custom Exchange Types

### consistent-hash

The [consistent hashing AMQP exchange
type](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange)
is a custom exchange type developed as a RabbitMQ plugin. It uses
[consistent
hashing](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/consistent-hashing/) to route
messages to queues. This helps distribute messages between queues more
or less evenly.

A quote from the project README:

> In various scenarios, you may wish to ensure that messages sent to an exchange are consistently and equally distributed across a number of different queues based on
> the routing key of the message. You could arrange for this to occur yourself by using a direct or topic exchange, binding queues to that exchange and then publishing
> messages to that exchange that match the various binding keys.
> 
> However, arranging things this way can be problematic:
> 
> It is difficult to ensure that all queues bound to the exchange will receive a (roughly) equal number of messages without baking in to the publishers quite a lot of
> knowledge about the number of queues and their bindings.
> 
> If the number of queues changes, it is not easy to ensure that the new topology still distributes messages between the different queues evenly.
> 
> Consistent Hashing is a hashing technique whereby each bucket appears at multiple points throughout the hash space, and the bucket selected is the nearest
> higher (or lower, it doesn't matter, provided it's consistent) bucket to the computed hash (and the hash space wraps around). The effect of this is that when a new
> bucket is added or an existing bucket removed, only a very few hashes change which bucket they are routed to.
> 
> In the case of Consistent Hashing as an exchange type, the hash is calculated from the hash of the routing key of each message received. Thus messages that have
> the same routing key will have the same hash computed, and thus will be routed to the same queue, assuming no bindings have changed.

### x-random

The [x-random AMQP exchange
type](https://github.com/jbrisbin/random-exchange) is a custom
exchange type developed as a RabbitMQ plugin by Jon Brisbin.  A quote
from the project README:

> It is basically a direct exchange, with the exception that, instead of each consumer bound to that exchange with the same routing key
> getting a copy of the message, the exchange type randomly selects a queue to route to.

## Using the Publisher Confirms Extension

Please refer to [RabbitMQ Extensions guide](/articles/extensions.html)


### Message Acknowledgements and Their Relationship to Transactions and Publisher Confirms

Consumer applications (applications that receive and process messages)
may occasionally fail to process individual messages, or might just
crash. Additionally, network issues might be experienced. This raises
a question - "when should the RabbitMQ remove messages from queues?"
This topic is covered in depth in the [Queues
guide](/articles/queues.html), including prefetching and examples.

In this guide, we will only mention how message acknowledgements are
related to AMQP transactions and the Publisher Confirms extension. Let
us consider a publisher application (P) that communications with a
consumer (C) using AMQP 0.9.1. Their communication can be graphically
represented like this:

<pre>
-----       -----       -----
|   |   S1  |   |   S2  |   |
| P | ====> | B | ====> | C |
|   |       |   |       |   |
-----       -----       -----
</pre>

We have two network segments, S1 and S2. Each of them may fail. A publisher (P) is concerned with making sure that messages cross S1, while the broker (B) and consumer (C) are concerned
with ensuring that messages cross S2 and are only removed from the queue when they are processed successfully.

Message acknowledgements cover reliable delivery over S2 as well as successful processing. For S1, P has to use transactions (a heavyweight solution) or the more
lightweight Publisher Confirms, a RabbitMQ-specific extension.


## Binding Queues to Exchanges

Queues are bound to exchanges using `Bunny::Queue#bind`. This topic is
described in detail in the [Queues and Consumers
guide](/articles/queues.html).


## Unbinding Queues from Exchanges

Queues are unbound from exchanges using `Bunny::Queue#unbind`. This
topic is described in detail in the [Queues and Consumers
guide](/articles/queues.html).

## Deleting Exchanges

### Explicitly Deleting an Exchange

Exchanges are deleted using the `Bunny::Exchange#delete`:

``` ruby
x = ch.topic("groups.013c6a65a1de9b15658446c6570ec39ff615ba15")
x.delete
```

### Auto-deleted exchanges

Exchanges can be *auto-deleted*. To declare an exchange as
auto-deleted, use the `:auto_delete` option on declaration:

``` ruby
ch.topic("groups.013c6a65a1de9b15658446c6570ec39ff615ba15", :auto_delete => true)
```

An auto-deleted exchange is removed when the last queue bound to it
is unbound.


## Exchange durability vs Message durability

See [Durability guide](/articles/durability.html)



## Wrapping Up

Publishers publish messages to exchanges. Messages are then routed to queues according to rules called bindings
that applications define. There are 4 built-in exchange types in RabbitMQ and it is possible to create custom
types.

Messages have a set of standard properties (e.g. type, content type) and can carry an arbitrary map
of headers.

Most functions related to exchanges and publishing are found in two Bunny classes:

 * `Bunny::Exchange`
 * `Bunny::Channel`
