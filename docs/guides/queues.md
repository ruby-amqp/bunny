## Queues in AMQP 0.9.1: Overview

### What are AMQP Queues?

*Queues* store and forward messages to consumers. They are similar to
mailboxes in SMTP. Messages flow from producing applications to
[exchanges](/articles/exchanges.html) that route them to queues and
finally, queues deliver the messages to consumer applications (or
consumer applications fetch messages as needed).

**Note** that unlike some other messaging protocols/systems, messages
are not delivered directly to queues. They are delivered to exchanges
that route messages to queues using rules known as *bindings*.

AMQP 0.9.1 is a programmable protocol, so queues and bindings alike are
declared by applications.

### Concept of Bindings

A *binding* is an association between a queue and an exchange. Queues
must be bound to at least one exchange in order to receive messages
from publishers. Learn more about bindings in the [Bindings
guide](/articles/bindings.html).

### Queue Attributes

Queues have several attributes associated with them:

 * Name
 * Exclusivity
 * Durability
 * Whether the queue is auto-deleted when no longer used
 * Other metadata (sometimes called *X-arguments*)

These attributes define how queues can be used, their life-cycle, and
other aspects of queue behavior.

## Queue Names and Declaring Queues

Every AMQP queue has a name that identifies it. Queue names often
contain several segments separated by a dot ".", in a similar fashion
to URI path segments being separated by a slash "/", although almost
any string can represent a segment (with some limitations - see
below).

Before a queue can be used, it has to be *declared*. Declaring a queue
will cause it to be created if it does not already exist. The
declaration will have no effect if the queue does already exist and
its attributes are the *same as those in the declaration*. When the
existing queue attributes are not the same as those in the declaration
a channel-level exception is raised. This case is explained later in
this guide.

### Explicitly Named Queues

Applications may pick queue names or ask the broker to generate a name
for them.

To declare a queue with a particular name, for example,
"images.resize", use the `Bunny::Channel#queue` method:

``` ruby
ch.queue("images.resize", :exclusive => false, :auto_delete => true)
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q    = ch.queue("images.resize", :exclusive => false, :auto_delete => true)
```


### Server-named queues

To ask an AMQP broker to generate a unique queue name for you, pass an
*empty string* as the queue name argument. A generated queue name
(like *amq.gen-JZ46KgZEOZWg-pAScMhhig*) will be assigned to the
`Bunny::Queue` instance that the method returns:

``` ruby
ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q    = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
```

**Note** that, while it is common to declare server-named queues as
  `:exclusive`, it is not necessary.


### Reserved Queue Name Prefix

Queue names starting with "amq." are reserved for server-named queues
and queues for internal use by the broker. Attempts to declare a queue
with a name that violates this rule will result in a channel-level
exception with reply code `403 (ACCESS_REFUSED)` and a reply message
similar to this:

    ACCESS_REFUSED - queue name 'amq.queue' contains reserved prefix 'amq.*'

This error results in the channel that was used for the declaration
being forcibly closed by RabbitMQ. If the program subsequently tries
to communicate with RabbitMQ using the same channel without re-opening
it then Bunny will raise a `Bunny::ChannelAlreadyClosed` error.

### Queue Re-Declaration With Different Attributes

When queue declaration attributes are different from those that the
queue already has, a channel-level exception with code `406
(PRECONDITION_FAILED)` will be raised. The reply text will be similar
to this:

    PRECONDITION_FAILED - parameters for queue 'bunny.examples.channel_exception' in vhost '/' not equivalent

This error results in the channel that was used for the declaration
being forcibly closed by RabbitMQ. If the program subsequently tries
to communicate with RabbitMQ using the same channel without re-opening
it then Bunny will raise a `Bunny::ChannelAlreadyClosed` error. In
order to continue communications in the same program after such an
error, a different channel would have to be used.

## Queue Life-cycle Patterns

According to the AMQP 0.9.1 specification, there are two common message queue life-cycle patterns:

 * Durable queues that are shared by many consumers and have an independent existence: i.e. they will continue to exist and collect messages whether or not there are consumers to receive them.
 * Temporary queues that are private to one consumer and are tied to that consumer. When the consumer disconnects, the message queue is deleted.

There are some variations of these, such as shared message queues that
are deleted when the last of many consumers disconnects.

Let us examine the example of a well-known service like an event
collector (event logger). A logger is usually up and running
regardless of the existence of services that want to log anything at a
particular point in time. Other applications know which queues to use
in order to communicate with the logger and can rely on those queues
being available and able to survive broker restarts. In this case,
explicitly named durable queues are optimal and the coupling that is
created between applications is not an issue.

Another example of a well-known long-lived service is a distributed
metadata/directory/locking server like [Apache
Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org), [Google's
Chubby](https://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html) or DNS. Services
like this benefit from using well-known, not server-generated, queue
names and so do any other applications that use them.

A different sort of scenario is in "a cloud setting" when some kind of
worker/instance might start and stop at any time so that other
applications cannot rely on it being available. In this case, it is
possible to use well-known queue names, but a much better solution is
to use server-generated, short-lived queues that are bound to topic or
fanout exchanges in order to receive relevant messages.

Imagine a service that processes an endless stream of events â€” Twitter
is one example. When traffic increases, development operations may
start additional application instances in the cloud to handle the
load. Those new instances want to subscribe to receive messages to
process, but the rest of the system does not know anything about them
and cannot rely on them being online or try to address them
directly. The new instances process events from a shared stream and
are the same as their peers. In a case like this, there is no reason
for message consumers not to use queue names generated by the broker.

In general, use of explicitly named or server-named queues depends on
the messaging pattern that your application needs. [Enterprise
Integration Patterns](http://www.eaipatterns.com/) discusses many
messaging patterns in depth and the RabbitMQ FAQ also has a section on
[use cases](http://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html#scenarios).

## Declaring a Durable Shared Queue

To declare a durable shared queue, you pass a queue name that is a
non-blank string and use the `:durable` option:

``` ruby
ch.queue("images.resize", :durable => true, :auto_delete => false)
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q    = ch.queue("images.resize", :durable => true, :auto_delete => false)
```


## Declaring a Temporary Exclusive Queue

To declare a server-named, exclusive, auto-deleted queue, pass "" (an
empty string) as the queue name and use the `:exclusive` option:

``` ruby
ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q    = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
```

Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection and
are deleted when that connection closes. The declaration of an
exclusive queue by other connections is not allowed and will result in
a channel-level exception with the code `405 (RESOURCE_LOCKED)`

Exclusive queues will be deleted when the connection they were
declared on is closed.


## Checking if a Queue Exists

Sometimes it's convenient to check if a queue exists. To do so, at the protocol
level you use `queue.declare` with `passive` seto to `true`. In response
RabbitMQ responds with a channel exception if the queue does not exist.

Bunny provides a convenience method, `Bunny::Session#queue_exists?`, to do this:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

conn.queue_exists?("logs.info")
```


## Binding Queues to Exchanges

In order to receive messages, a queue needs to be bound to at least
one exchange. Most of the time binding is explcit (done by
applications). **Please note:** All queues are automatically bound to
the default unnamed RabbitMQ direct exchange with a routing key that
is the same as the queue name (see [Exchanges and
Publishing](/articles/exchanges.html) guide for more details).

To bind a queue to an exchange,
use the `Bunny::Queue#bind` method:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
x = ch.fanout("logging.events")

q.bind(x)
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
x = ch.fanout("logging.events")

q.bind(x)
```


## Subscribing to receive messages ("push API")

To request that the server starts a *consumer* (queue subscription) to
enable an application to process messages as they arrive in a queue,
one uses the `Bunny::Queue#subscribe` or `Bunny::Queue#subscribe_with`
methods.

Consumers last as long as the channel that they were declared on,
or until the client cancels them (unsubscribes).

Consumers have a number of events that they can react to:

 * Message delivery
 * Consumer registration confirmation
 * Consumer cancellation

#### Consumer Tags

Consumers are identified by unique strings called *consumer tags*. The
`Bunny::Queue#subscribe` method can take a `:consumer_tag` argument or
let RabbitMQ generate one

```ruby
q.subscribe(:consumer_tag => "unique_consumer_001")
```

### Handling Messages With a Block

A message handler will process messages that RabbitMQ pushes to the consumer.
One way to define a handler is:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
q.subscribe(:manual_ack => true) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "Received #{payload}, message properties are #{properties.inspect}"
end
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true)
q.subscribe(:manual_ack => true) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts "Received #{payload}, message properties are #{properties.inspect}"
end
```

The block should accept three arguments:

 * Delivery information (can be used to acknowledge messages, for example; will be covered later)
 * Message properties (metadata)
 * Message payload (body)

Both delivery information and message properties can be treated as
Hash-like objects or structures.  For example, to get delivery tag,
you can use either

``` ruby
delivery_info[:delivery_tag]
```

or

``` ruby
delivery_info.delivery_tag
```

#### Asynchronous Consumers Don't Run on the Caller Thread

The subscribe method will not use the caller thread. If invoked
from the main thread, it will not keep that thread running. That's a
responsibility of application developer. It usually can be worked around
with something like

``` ruby
loop { sleep 5 }
```

### Accessing Message Delivery Information

The *delivery_info* parameter in the example above provides access to
message delivery information:

 * Consumer tag this delivery is for
 * Delivery tag
 * Whether or not message is redelivered
 * Name of exchange message came from
 * Message routing key

Message delivery information can be treated as a Hash-like object or
structure.  For example, to get routing key, you can use either

``` ruby
delivery_info[:routing_key]
```

or

``` ruby
delivery_info.routing_key
```

### Accessing Message Properties (Metadata)

The *properties* parameter in the example above provides access to
message metadata:

 * Message content type
 * Message content encoding
 * Message delivery mode (persistent or not)
 * Message priority
 * Producer application id

Message properties can be treated as a Hash-like object or structure.
For example, to get message type, you can use either

``` ruby
properties[:type]
```

or

``` ruby
properties.type
```

An example to demonstrate how to access some of those attributes:

``` ruby
require 'bunny'

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start

ch = connection.create_channel
q = ch.queue('', :exclusive => true)
x  = ch.default_exchange

# set up the consumer
q.subscribe(:exclusive => true, :manual_ack => false) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts properties.content_type # => "application/octet-stream"
  puts properties.priority     # => 8

  puts properties.headers["time"] # => a Time instance

  puts properties.headers["coordinates"]["latitude"] # => 59.35
  puts properties.headers["participants"]            # => 11
  puts properties.headers["venue"]                   # => "Stockholm"
  puts properties.headers["true_field"]              # => true
  puts properties.headers["false_field"]             # => false
  puts properties.headers["nil_field"]               # => nil
  puts properties.headers["ary_field"].inspect       # => ["one", 2.0, 3, [{ "abc" => 123}]]

  puts properties.timestamp      # => a Time instance
  puts properties.type           # => "kinda.checkin"
  puts properties.reply_to       # => "a.sender"
  puts properties.correlation_id # => "r-1"
  puts properties.message_id     # => "m-1"
  puts properties.app_id         # => "bunny.example"

  puts delivery_info.consumer_tag # => a string
  puts delivery_info.redelivered? # => false
  puts delivery_info.delivery_tag # => 1
  puts delivery_info.routing_key  # => server generated queue name prefixed with "amq.gen-"
  puts delivery_info.exchange     # => ""
end

# publishing
x.publish("hello",
          :routing_key => "#{q.name}",
          :app_id      => "bunny.example",
          :priority    => 8,
          :type        => "kinda.checkin",
          # headers table keys can be anything
          :headers     => {
            :coordinates => {
              :latitude  => 59.35,
              :longitude => 18.066667
            },
            :time         => Time.now,
            :participants => 11,
            :venue        => "Stockholm",
            :true_field   => true,
            :false_field  => false,
            :nil_field    => nil,
            :ary_field    => ["one", 2.0, 3, [{"abc" => 123}]]
          },
          :timestamp      => Time.now.to_i,
          :reply_to       => "a.sender",
          :correlation_id => "r-1",
          :message_id     => "m-1")

sleep 1.0
connection.close
```
The full list of message delivery information parameters is:

 * `:consumer_tag`
 * `:delivery_tag`
 * `:redelivered`
 * `:exchange`
 * `:routing_key`

The full list of message properties parameters (**note** that most of them are optional and may not be present) is:

 * `:content_type` _(always present)_
 * `:content_encoding`
 * `:headers`
 * `:delivery_mode` _(always present)_
 * `:priority` _(always present)_
 * `:correlation_id`
 * `:reply_to`
 * `:expiration`
 * `:message_id`
 * `:timestamp`
 * `:type`
 * `:user_id`
 * `:app_id`
 * `:cluster_id`



### Consumer Instances

Starting with version 0.9, Bunny provides a new `Bunny::Consumer`
class which takes the following positional arguments when
instantiated:

 * `channel` _(mandatory)_
 * `queue` _(mandatory)_
 * `consumer_tag` _(default = "")_
 * `no_ack` _(default = true)_
 * `exclusive` _(default = false)_
 * `arguments` _(default = {})_

To create a consumer object:

```ruby
class ExampleConsumer < Bunny::Consumer
  def cancelled?
    @cancelled
  end

  def handle_cancellation(_)
    @cancelled = true
  end
end

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start

ch = connection.create_channel
q = ch.queue("testq")

consumer = ExampleConsumer.new(ch, q, "my_example_consumer", false, false, {:test_arg => 'test'})
```

or

```ruby
consumer = ExampleConsumer.new(ch, q)
```

If the `consumer_tag` is empty then Bunny will generate one that looks something like *bunny-1357204208000-17043847598*, but it can also be set in the code:

```ruby
consumer.consumer_tag = "another_example_consumer"
```

`Bunny::Consumer` implements a *delivery handler* and when the consumer
consumes a message then the delivery information, message properties
(metadata) and body (payload) are passed to it. In order to process
consumed messages a block is passed to the consumer:

```ruby
consumer.on_delivery do |delivery_info, metadata, payload|
  puts payload
end
```

Consumers may need to react to events other than message delivery.
For example, consumers can be cancelled by RabbitMQ in some situations:

 * When a consumer is cancelled via the RabbitMQ Management UI
 * When the queue from which messages are consumed is deleted

To handle these *consumer cancellation notification* events, consumers have a *cancellation handler* (see the `handle_cancellation` method in the example below).


### Registering Consumer Instances

To register a consumer and start consuming messages, pass a consumer object to the `Bunny::Queue#subscribe_with` method. Here is a full example:

```ruby
require 'bunny'

# Define consumer subclass
class ExampleConsumer < Bunny::Consumer
  def cancelled?
    @cancelled
  end

  def handle_cancellation(_)
    @cancelled = true
  end
end

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start

consumer = nil

ch1 = connection.create_channel

t = Thread.new do
  ch2 = connection.create_channel
  q = ch2.queue("testq")

  consumer = ExampleConsumer.new(ch2, q)

  # Pass block to consumer delivery handler
  consumer.on_delivery() do |delivery_info, metadata, payload|
    puts payload
  end

  # Register the consumer
  q.subscribe_with(consumer)
end
t.abort_on_exception = true

sleep 0.5

x = ch1.default_exchange

# Publish messages
x.publish('Hello', :routing_key => "testq")
x.publish('World', :routing_key => "testq")

sleep 0.5

# Delete the queue triggering the consumer cancellation handler
ch1.queue("testq").delete

sleep 0.5

puts 'Consumer has been cancelled' if consumer.cancelled?

sleep 2
connection.close
```


### Using Multiple Consumers Per Queue

It is possible to have multiple non-exclusive consumers on queues. In that case, messages will be
distributed between them according to prefetch levels of their channels (more on this later in this
guide). If prefetch values are equal for all consumers, each consumer will get about the same number of messages.


### Consumer Priorities

As of RabbitMQ 3.2, [consumers that share a channel can have priorities](http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-priority.html).

To specify a priority with Bunny, use the `:arguments` option that `Bunny::Queue#subscribe`
and `Bunny::Queue#subscribe_with` take:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("a.queue")
q.subscribe(:manual_ack => true, :arguments => {"x-priority" => 5}) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # ...
end
q.subscribe(:manual_ack => true, :arguments => {"x-priority" => 2}) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # ...
end
```

### Exception Handling in Consumers

Consumers are expected to handle any exceptions that arise during handling of deliveries
or any other consumer operations. Such exceptions should be logged, collected and ignored.

Unhandled exceptions will kill consumer dispatch pool threads and eventually lead to Bunny
being unable to dispatch/process deliveries.

If a consumer cannot process deliveries due to a dependency not being available or similar reasons
it should clearly log so and cancel itself until it is capable of processing deliveries again.
This will make the consumer's unavailability visible to RabbitMQ and [monitoring systems](https://rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html).


### Exclusive Consumers

Consumers can request exclusive access to the queue (meaning only this
consumer can access the queue). This is useful when you want a
long-lived shared queue to be temporarily accessible by just one
application (or thread, or process). If the application employing the
exclusive consumer crashes or loses the TCP connection to the broker,
then the channel is closed and the exclusive consumer is cancelled.

To exclusively receive messages from the queue, pass the `:exclusive`
option to `Bunny::Queue#subscribe`:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("")
q.subscribe(:manual_ack => true, :exclusive => true) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # ...
end
```

or the positional `exclusive` parameter to your `Bunny::Consumer` subclass:

``` ruby
class ExampleConsumer < Bunny::Consumer
  def cancelled?
    @cancelled
  end

  def handle_cancellation(_)
    @cancelled = true
  end
end

# channel, queue, consumer tag, no_ack, exclusive
consumer = ExampleConsumer.new(ch, q, "", false, true)
q.subscribe_with(consumer)
```

Attempts to register another consumer on a queue that already has an
exclusive consumer will result in a channel-level exception with reply
code `403 (ACCESS_REFUSED)` and a reply message similar to this:

    ACCESS_REFUSED - queue 'queue name' in vhost '/' in exclusive use (Bunny::AccessRefused)

It is not possible to register an exclusive consumer on a queue that
already has consumers.


### Cancelling a Consumer

Sometimes there may be a requirement to cancel a consumer directly
without deleting the queue that it is subscribed to. In AMQP 0.9.1
parlance, "cancelling a consumer" is often referred to as
"unsubscribing". The `Bunny::Consumer#cancel` method can be used to do
this. Here is a usage example :

``` ruby
require 'bunny'

connection = Bunny.new
connection.start

ch         = connection.create_channel
q          = ch.queue("", :auto_delete => true, :durable => false)

consumer   = q.subscribe(:block => false) do |_, _, payload|
  puts payload
end

puts "Consumer: #{consumer.consumer_tag} created"

sleep 1

# Cancel consumer
cancel_ok = consumer.cancel

puts "Consumer: #{cancel_ok.consumer_tag} cancelled"

ch.close
```

In the above example, you can see that the `Bunny::Consumer#cancel`
method returns a *cancel_ok* reply from RabbitMQ which contains the
consumer tag of the cancelled consumer.

Once a consumer is cancelled, messages will no longer be delivered to
it, however, due to the asynchronous nature of the protocol, it is
possible for "in flight" messages to be received after this call
completes.

### Message Acknowledgements

Consumer applications â€” applications that receive and process messages
â€š may occasionally fail to process individual messages, or will just
crash.  There is also the possibility of network issues causing
problems. This raises a question â€” "When should the AMQP broker remove
messages from queues?"

The AMQP 0.9.1 specification proposes two choices:

 * After broker sends a message to an application (using either basic.deliver or basic.get-ok methods).
 * After the application sends back an acknowledgement (using basic.ack AMQP method).

The former choice is called the *automatic acknowledgement model*,
while the latter is called the *explicit acknowledgement model*.  With
the explicit model, the application chooses when it is time to send an
acknowledgement. It can be right after receiving a message, or after
persisting it to a data store before processing, or after fully
processing the message (for example, successfully fetching a Web page,
processing and storing it into some persistent data store).

![Message Acknowledgements](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/006_amqp_091_message_acknowledgements.png)

If a consumer dies without sending an acknowledgement, the AMQP broker
will redeliver it to another consumer, or, if none are available at
the time, the broker will wait until at least one consumer is
registered for the same queue before attempting redelivery.

The acknowledgement model is chosen when a new consumer is registered
for a queue. By default, `Bunny::Queue#subscribe` will use the
*automatic* model.  To switch to the *explicit* model, the `:manual_ack`
option should be used:

``` ruby
q = ch.queue("", :exclusive => true).subscribe(:manual_ack => true) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # ...
end
```

To demonstrate how redelivery works, let us have a look at the
following code example:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

puts "=> Subscribing for messages using explicit acknowledgements model"
puts

connection1 = Bunny.new
connection1.start

connection2 = Bunny.new
connection2.start

connection3 = Bunny.new
connection3.start

ch1 = connection1.create_channel

ch2 = connection2.create_channel

ch3 = connection3.create_channel

x   = ch3.direct("amq.direct")
q1  = ch1.queue("bunny.examples.acknowledgements.explicit", :auto_delete => false)
q1.purge

q1.bind(x).subscribe(:manual_ack => true, :block => false) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # do some work
  sleep(0.2)

  # acknowledge some messages, they will be removed from the queue
  if rand > 0.5
    # FYI: there is a shortcut, Bunny::Channel.ack
    ch1.acknowledge(delivery_info.delivery_tag, false)
    puts "[consumer1] Got message ##{properties.headers['i']}, redelivered?: #{delivery_info.redelivered?}, ack-ed"
  else
    # some messages are not ack-ed and will remain in the queue for redelivery
    # when app #1 connection is closed (either properly or due to a crash)
    puts "[consumer1] Got message ##{properties.headers['i']}, SKIPPED"
  end
end

q2   = ch2.queue("bunny.examples.acknowledgements.explicit", :auto_delete => false)
q2.bind(x).subscribe(:manual_ack => true, :block => false) do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  # do some work
  sleep(0.2)

  ch2.acknowledge(delivery_info.delivery_tag, false)
  puts "[consumer2] Got message ##{properties.headers['i']}, redelivered?: #{delivery_info.redelivered?}, ack-ed"
end

t1 = Thread.new do
  i = 0
  loop do
    sleep 0.5

    x.publish("Message ##{i}", :headers => { :i => i })
    i += 1
  end
end
t1.abort_on_exception = true

t2 = Thread.new do
  sleep 4.0

  connection1.close
  puts "----- Connection 1 is now closed (we pretend that it has crashed) -----"
end
t2.abort_on_exception = true


sleep 10.0
connection2.close
connection3.close
```

So what is going on here? This example uses three AMQP connections to
imitate three applications, one producer and two consumers.  Each
connection opens a single channel. The consumers share a queue and the
producer publishes messages to the queue periodically using an
`amq.direct` exchange.

Both "applications" subscribe to receive messages using the explicit
acknowledgement model. The RabbitMQ broker by default will send each
message to the next consumer in sequence (this kind of load balancing
is known as *round-robin*). This means that some messages will be
delivered to consumer #1 and some to consumer #2.

To demonstrate message redelivery we make consumer #1 randomly select
which messages to acknowledge. After 4 seconds we disconnect it (to
imitate a crash).  When that happens, the RabbitMQ broker redelivers
unacknowledged messages to consumer #2 which acknowledges them
unconditionally. After 10 seconds, this example closes all outstanding
connections and exits.

An extract of output produced by this example:

```
=> Subscribing for messages using explicit acknowledgements model

[consumer1] Got message #0, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #1, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer1] Got message #2, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #3, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer1] Got message #4, SKIPPED
[consumer2] Got message #5, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer1] Got message #6, SKIPPED
----- Connection 1 is now closed (we pretend that it has crashed) -----
[consumer2] Got message #4, redelivered?: true, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #6, redelivered?: true, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #7, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #8, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #9, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #10, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #11, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #12, redelivered?: false, ack-ed
```

As we can see, consumer #1 did not acknowledge two messages (labelled 4 and 6):

```
[consumer1] Got message #4, SKIPPED
[consumer1] Got message #6, SKIPPED
...

```

and then, once consumer #1 had "crashed", the messages were immediately redelivered to the consumer #2:

```
----- Connection 1 is now closed (we pretend that it has crashed) -----
[consumer2] Got message #4, redelivered?: true, ack-ed
[consumer2] Got message #6, redelivered?: true, ack-ed
```

To acknowledge a message use `Bunny::Channel#acknowledge`:

```
# FYI: there is a shortcut, Bunny::Channel.ack
ch1.acknowledge(delivery_info.delivery_tag, false)
```

`Bunny::Channel#acknowledge` takes two arguments: a message *delivery
tag* and a flag that indicates whether or not we want to acknowledge
multiple messages at once.  Delivery tag is simply a channel-specific
increasing number that the server uses to identify deliveries.

When acknowledging multiple messages at once, the delivery tag is
treated as "up to and including". For example, if delivery tag = 5
that would mean "acknowledge messages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5".

**Please note:** Acknowledgements are channel-specific. Applications
  MUST NOT receive messages on one channel and acknowledge them on
  another.

Also, a message MUST NOT be acknowledged more than once. Doing so will
result in a channel-level exception with code `406
(PRECONDITION_FAILED)` being raised. The reply text will be similar to
this:

    PRECONDITION_FAILED - unknown delivery tag


### Rejecting messages

When a consumer application receives a message, processing of that
message may or may not succeed. An application can indicate to the
broker that message processing has failed (or cannot be accomplished
at the time) by rejecting a message. When rejecting a message, an
application can ask the broker to discard or requeue it.

To reject a message use the `Bunny::Channel#reject` method:

``` ruby
ch1.reject(delivery_info.delivery_tag)
```

in the example above, messages are rejected without requeueing (broker
will simply discard them). To requeue a rejected message, use the
second argument that `Bunny::Queue#reject` takes:

``` ruby
ch1.reject(delivery_info.delivery_tag, true)
```

### Negative acknowledgements

Messages are rejected with the `basic.reject` AMQP method. However,
there is one notable limitation that `basic.reject` has: there is no
way to reject multiple messages, as you can do with
acknowledgements. However, if you are using
[RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com), then there is a solution.  RabbitMQ
provides an AMQP 0.9.1 extension known as [negative
acknowledgements](http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#negative-acknowledgements)
(nacks) and Bunny supports this extension. For more information,
please refer to the [RabbitMQ Extensions
guide](/articles/extensions.html).

### QoS â€” Prefetching messages

For cases when multiple consumers share a queue, it is useful to be
able to specify how many messages each consumer can be sent at once
before sending the next acknowledgement.  This can be used as a sample
load balancing technique to improve throughput if messages tend to be
published in batches. For example, if a producing application sends
messages every minute because of the nature of the work it is doing.

Imagine a website that takes data from social media sources like
Twitter or Facebook during the Champions League (European soccer)
final (or The Super Bowl), and then calculates how many tweets
mention a particular team in the last minute. The site could be
structured as 3 applications:

 * A crawler that uses streaming APIs to fetch tweets/statuses, normalizes them and sends them in JSON for processing by other applications ("app A").
 * A calculator that detects what team is mentioned in a message, updates statistics and pushes an update to the Web UI once a minute ("app B").
 * A Web UI that fans visit to see the stats ("app C").

In this imaginary example, the "tweets per second" rate will vary, but
to improve the throughput of the system and to decrease the maximum
number of messages that the AMQP broker has to hold in memory at once,
applications can be designed in such a way that application "app B",
the "calculator", receives 5000 messages and then acknowledges them
all at once. The broker will not send message 5001 unless it receives
an acknowledgement.

In AMQP 0.9.1 parlance this is known as *QoS* or *message
prefetching*. Prefetching is configured on a per-channel basis.  To
configure prefetching use the `Bunny::Channel#prefetch` method like
so:

``` ruby
ch1 = connection1.create_channel
ch1.prefetch(10)
```

**Note** that the prefetch setting is ignored for consumers that do
  not use explicit acknowledgements.


## How Message Acknowledgements Relate to Transactions and Publisher Confirms

In cases where you cannot afford to lose a single message, AMQP 0.9.1
applications can use one or a combination of the following protocol
features:

 * Publisher confirms (a RabbitMQ-specific extension to AMQP 0.9.1)
 * Publishing messages as immediate
 * Transactions (noticeable overhead)

This topic is covered in depth in the [Working With
Exchanges](/articles/exchanges.html) guide. In this guide, we will
only mention how message acknowledgements are related to AMQP
transactions and the Publisher Confirms extension.

Let us consider a publisher application (P) that communicates with a
consumer (C) using AMQP 0.9.1. Their communication can be graphically
represented like this:

<pre>
-----       -----       -----
|   |   S1  |   |   S2  |   |
| P | ====> | B | ====> | C |
|   |       |   |       |   |
-----       -----       -----
</pre>

We have two network segments, S1 and S2, either of which might fail. P
is concerned with making sure that messages cross S1, while brokers B
and C are concerned with ensuring that messages cross S2 and are only
removed from the queue when they are processed successfully.

Message acknowledgements cover reliable delivery over S2 as well as
successful processing. For S1, P has to use transactions (a
heavyweight solution) or the more lightweight Publisher Confirms
RabbitMQ extension.


## Fetching messages when needed ("pull API")

The AMQP 0.9.1 specification also provides a way for applications to
fetch (pull) messages from the queue only when necessary.  For that,
use the `Bunny::Queue#pop` function which returns a triple of
`[delivery_info, properties, payload]`:

``` ruby
delivery_info, properties, payload = q.pop
```

The same example in context:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

chann = conn.create_channel

q = chann.queue("test1")

exch = chann.default_exchange

exch.publish("Hello, everybody!", :routing_key => 'test1')

delivery_info, properties, payload = q.pop

puts "This is the message: " + payload + "\n\n"

conn.close
```

The message properties are the same as those provided for delivery handlers (see the "Push API" section above).

If the queue is empty, then `[nil, nil, nil]` will be returned.


## Unbinding Queues From Exchanges

To unbind a queue from an exchange use the `Bunny::Queue#unbind` function:

``` ruby
q.unbind(x)
```

**Note** that trying to unbind a queue from an exchange that the queue
was never bound to will result in a channel-level exception.

## Querying the Number of Messages and Consumers for a Queue

It is possible to query the number of messages in a queue and the
number of consumers it has by declaring the queue with the `:passive`
attribute set.  The response (`queue.declare-ok` AMQP method) will
include the number of messages along with the number of
consumers. However, Bunny provides a convenience method,
`Bunny::Queue#status`, that returns a hash containing `:message_count`
and `:consumer_count`. There are two further convenience methods that
provide both pieces of information individually

 * `Bunny::Queue#message_count`
 * `Bunny::Queue#consumer_count`

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch = conn.channel

q = ch.queue("testq")

# Display message count
puts q.message_count

# Display consumer count
puts q.consumer_count
```

**Please note:** The message count DOES NOT include unacknowledged messages.

## Purging queues

It is possible to purge a queue (remove all of the messages from it) using the `Bunny::Queue#purge` method:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch = conn.channel

q = ch.queue("")

q.purge
```

**Note** that this example purges a newly declared queue with a unique
server-generated name. When a queue is declared, it is empty, so for
server-named queues, there is no need to purge them before they are
used.

## Deleting Queues

Queues can be deleted either indirectly or directly. To delete a queue
indirectly you can include either of the following two arguments in
the queue declaration:

  * `:exclusive => true`
  * `:auto_delete => true`

If the *exclusive* flag is set to true then the queue will be deleted
when the connection that was used to declare it is closed.

If the *auto_delete* flag is set to true then the queue will be
deleted when there are no more consumers subscribed to it. The queue
will remain in existence until at least one consumer accesses it.

To delete a queue directly, use the `Bunny::Queue#delete` method:

``` ruby
require "bunny"

conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch = conn.channel

q = ch.queue("")

q.delete
```

When a queue is deleted, all of the messages in it are deleted as well.

## RabbitMQ Extensions Related to Queues

See [RabbitMQ Extensions guide](/articles/extensions.html)


## Wrapping Up

In RabbitMQ, queues can be client-named or server-named. It is
possible to either subscribe for messages to be pushed to consumers
(register a consumer) or pull messages from the client as
needed. Consumers are identified by consumer tags.

For messages to be routed to queues, queues need to be bound to exchanges.

Most methods related to queues are found in three Bunny namespaces:

 * `Bunny::Channel`
 * `Bunny::Consumer`
 * `Bunny::Queue`
